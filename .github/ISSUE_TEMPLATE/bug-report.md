**Metadata (please complete the following information):**
Version: [e.g. v1.2.0 run `ani-cli -V` to get the version]
OS: [e.g. Windows 10 / Linux Mint 20.3]
Shell: [e.g. zsh, run `echo $SHELL` to get your shell]

**Describe the bug**
It seems like ani-cli can't find flcl episode 7.
When I try to watch it I get an "episode out of range" Error.

**To Reproduce**
1. Run `ani-cli -q 360 -v flcl`
2. Choose 2 (fooly-cooly)
3. Choose episode 7

**Expected behavior**
I thought flcl had an episode 7
*wink, this is a template. No flcl episode 7 exists*

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
