**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
I really like mpv, but it frustrates me that there is a better player I can't use yet: iina

**Describe the solution you'd like**
Please add iina, maybe through a `-i` flag analogous to the vlc `-v` flag

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
Maybe support any player string by the user, but I know thats drastically more difficult to achieve

**Additional context**
iina is just an mpv frontend and accepts its flags.
Needless to say it can play urls.
